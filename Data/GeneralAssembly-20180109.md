* 15 years ago big data big bang  
* Monetize data : Facebook, Google, Uber  
* Raw technology available as open source and becomes state of the art half a year later  
* Adoption gap : hiring data scientists , identify ROI, push to production  

Tools:  
. Jupyter interactive notebook  
. Scikit learn (started in Paris 2007) machine learning
